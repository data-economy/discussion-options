## Why are we using GitHub

Github is a distributed version management system that allow the members of the Collective, as well as research teams and consultants, to contribute insights into the Data Economy Collective submission. 

This is an area of ongoing collaboration and research.

The GitHub workflow manages or mitigates issues with managing email attachments, mis-aligned document versions and comparing changes. The latest version is stored in the repository and provided as releases.

## How to contribute

This website is hosted on GitHub and contributions are managed through the GitHub flow process which is well documented. 

To get started, create a GitHub account, and review this guide: [Understanding the GitHub Flow] (https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

To propose changes, branch the repository, make your changes and then propose a pull request - to pull your proposed changes into the main repository

Our values are to be open and inclusive and we value a wider range of contributions from the Data Economy community in New Zealand.
